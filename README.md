##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a project assignment for "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course from Coursera.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

###The goal include:

####create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. `Merges` the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. `Extracts` only the measurements on the `mean and standard deviation` for each measurement. 
3. Uses `descriptive activity names` to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with `descriptive variable names`. 
5. Creates a second, independent `tidy data set` with the `average of each variable for each activity and each subject`.

This repository contain scripts for completeing the above project. R is a programming language used to perform above task. 

###run_analysis.R 

This file include the full script from downloading to creating a tidy dataset for analysis. The comments describe the step by step process too. For detail process please read the forth and fifth section of `CodeBook.md` file.

###CodeBook.md

Details of data and its collection and feature selection process is described in CodeBook.md file. It aslo include links for downloading the data and its  full description.
